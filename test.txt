There have been a number of papers about the I/O characteristics
of storage workloads [16][12][18].
Kozyrakis et al. [18] presented a system-wide characterization
of large-scale online services provided by Microsoft and showed
the implications of such workloads on data-center server design.
Kavalanekar et al. [16] characterized large online services for storage
system configuration and performance modeling. It contains
a set of characteristics, including block-level statistics, multiparameter
distributions and rankings of file access frequencies.
Similarly, Delemitrou et al. [12] presented a concise statistical
model which accurately captures the I/O access pattern of largescale
applications including their spatial locality, inter-arrival times
and type of accesses.
